# ColorblindFilter

## Usage
  * Run `geeks-colorblind-correction.jar`
  * Load an image and choose the type of colorblindedness
  * Click `process image` and a new image with the correction filter is applied. This should make it easier for people with that type of colorblindedness
  * Revert to original picture by clicking `revert` button
  * The button `Generate all images` creates a folder called `output` where all the template images are processed and saved.
